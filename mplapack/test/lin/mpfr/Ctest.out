 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 1.0.0
 Based on the original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
        M  :     0     1     2     3     5    10    50
        N  :     0     1     2     3     5    10    50
     NRHS  :     1     2    15
       NB  :     1     3     3     3    20
       NX  :     1     0     5     9     1
     RANK  :    30    50    90

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   30.00

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be : 9.53026e-323228497
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be : 2.09858e+323228496
 Relative machine precision is taken to be : 7.45834e-155
 ZGE routines passed the tests of the error exits

 CGB drivers:  General band matrices
 Matrix types:
    1. Random, CNDNUM = 2              5. Random, CNDNUM = sqrt(0.1/EPS)
    2. First column zero               6. Random, CNDNUM = 0.1/EPS
    3. Last column zero                7. Scaled near underflow
    4. Last n/2 columns zero           8. Scaled near overflow
 Test ratios:
    1: norm( L * U - A )  / ( N * norm(A) * EPS )
    2: norm( B - A * X )  / ( norm(A) * norm(X) * EPS )
    3: norm( X - XACT )   / ( norm(XACT) * CNDNUM * EPS )
    4: norm( X - XACT )   / ( norm(XACT) * (error bound) )
    5: (backward error)   / EPS
    6: RCOND * CNDNUM - 1.0
    7: abs( WORK(1) - RPVGRW ) / ( max( WORK(1), RPVGRW ) * EPS )
