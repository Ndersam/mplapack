 Tests of the Symmetric Eigenvalue Problem routines
 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 1.0.0
 Based on original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5
    N:         0     1     2     3     5
    NB:        1     3    20
    NBMIN:     2     2     2
    NX:        1     1     1
 
 Relative machine underflow is taken to be+9.5302596195518043e-323228497
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be+2.0985787164673877e+323228496
 Relative machine precision is taken to be+7.4583407312002067e-155

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than+2.0000000000000000e+01

 DSG -- Real Symmetric Generalized eigenvalue problem
 Matrix types (see xDRVSG for details): 

 Special Matrices:
  1=Zero matrix.                          5=Diagonal: clustered entries.
  2=Identity matrix.                      6=Diagonal: large, evenly spaced.
  3=Diagonal: evenly spaced entries.      7=Diagonal: small, evenly spaced.
  4=Diagonal: geometr. spaced entries.
 Dense or Banded Symmetric Matrices: 
  8=Evenly spaced eigenvals.          15=Matrix with small random entries.
  9=Geometrically spaced eigenvals.   16=Evenly spaced eigenvals, KA=1, KB=1.
 10=Clustered eigenvalues.            17=Evenly spaced eigenvals, KA=2, KB=1.
 11=Large, evenly spaced eigenvals.   18=Evenly spaced eigenvals, KA=2, KB=2.
 12=Small, evenly spaced eigenvals.   19=Evenly spaced eigenvals, KA=3, KB=1.
 13=Matrix with random O(1) entries.  20=Evenly spaced eigenvals, KA=3, KB=2.
 14=Matrix with large random entries. 21=Evenly spaced eigenvals, KA=3, KB=3.

 and B is a random well-conditioned matrix. D is 
 diagonal, and Z is orthogonal. )
