The MPACK is a multiprecision linear algebra package based on BLAS and LAPACK.
This package is rewritten in C++, and supports several high precision
libraries like GMP, MPFR and QD etc so that users can choose for user's
convenience. The MPACK is a free software (2-clause BSD style license with
original license by LAPACK).

How to build:
$ git clone https://github.com/nakatamaho/mplapack/
$ cd mplapack ; autoreconf --force --install ; aclocal ; autoconf ; automake; autoreconf --force --install
$ ./configure --enable-gmp --enable-__float128 --enable-dd --enable-mpfr

do not worry about a lot of warnings in the second commands.
